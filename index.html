    <h1>This is a ScoreKeeper ping pong game. I had made this game with the help of html, css,
         javascript and bootstrap5. In this game there are three button Player one, Player two and reset button.
          Above this there is a select option where you have to choose the score option you want to play.
           After selecting the option you have yo can play the game. 
           if you click on the Player one option, its value will increment by one and same by Player two option. 
           from both who reaches the preffered select option says (9) the one will be winner and the its color will change to green(winner) and red to loser player. Both the Buttons will become disabled as soon as the we finish the game and then you can use reset button to play again.
            You can also use reset button that will reset the value of Player one & two value to zero. It will also make default value of select option. Hope you like my small game, Thanku.</h1>
